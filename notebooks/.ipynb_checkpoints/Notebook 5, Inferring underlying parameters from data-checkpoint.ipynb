    "In notebook 4 we investigated the connection between the underlying transmission process model and observable events . However, the actual dynamical state of the epidemic in a Kenyan county is not observable, instead we observe events that related to infection like testing PCR-positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (swab tests) or SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (serology tests). In this notebook we cover:\n",

    "* Translating the continuous time prediction of the ODE model into a discrete time prediction of daily infections.\n",
    "* The delay distributions between infection and an observable event:\n",
    "    - Time between infection and chance of being PCR detectable\n",
    "    - Time between infection and chance of being serologically detectable\n",
    "    - Time between infection and death, for those who die.\n",
    "* Combining the daily infections and the daily distributions to give daily estimates of the number of observable people who have been infected exist in the population.\n",
