    "In notebook 4 we investigated the connection between the underlying transmission process model and observable events. \n",
    "However, we used posterior mean estimates for the unknown parameters of the model. In this notebook, we look at how the posterior distributions for the parameters were generated. In this notebook we cover:\n",
